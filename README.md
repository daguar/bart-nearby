# Bart Nearby

Ultra-minimalist web site that gives you departure times for the BART station closest to you.

## How it works

All the work is done in [js/main.js](https://github.com/daguar/bart-nearby/blob/gh-pages/js/main.js) in the aptly-named "doShit" function.

Built with:
- [Geolib.js](https://github.com/manuelbieh/Geolib)
- BART geo data ([which they make available here!](http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/geo)) and munged with the awesome [CartoDB](http://www.cartodb.com)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
